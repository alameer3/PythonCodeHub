# Tool Project

## Overview
This project provides a remote desktop environment with VNC support, migrated from Docker to run natively in the Replit environment. It offers secure browser-based access to a full Linux desktop with GUI applications.

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Main Python script for desktop environment system
- `noVNC/` - Web-based VNC client with multiple interfaces:
  - `vnc.html` - Standard noVNC interface
  - `touch.html` - Touch-optimized interface for mobile devices
  - `mobile.html` - Advanced mobile interface with custom controls
  - `arabic.html` - Full Arabic RTL interface
  - `defaults.json` - Touch-optimized default settings
- `tool/` - Original Docker configuration (legacy):
  - `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for Ubuntu-based desktop environment
  - `start.sh` - Startup script for initializing services
- `.pythonlibs/` - Python virtual environment with websockify and dependencies

## User Preferences
- Language preference: Arabic (full RTL support required)
