# System Architecture

## Core Application Structure

The project follows a modular, package-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Package** (`core/`): Contains the main application orchestrator, custom exceptions, and central business logic
- **CLI Interface** (`cli/`): Command-line argument parsing and command handling with comprehensive help system
- **Configuration Management** (`config/`): Centralized settings management supporting both file-based and environment variable configuration
- **Data Processing** (`data/`): Data models, validation, and processing utilities with support for CSV and JSON formats
- **Services** (`services/`): External integrations including file operations and API communications
- **Utilities** (`utils/`): Common helper functions and decorators for timing, caching, and retry logic

## Desktop Environment System

The application includes multiple desktop interface implementations:

- **Simple Desktop** (`simple_desktop.py`): Web-based desktop interface using HTTP server with real-time interaction
- **Working Desktop** (`working_desktop.py`): Menu-driven console interface for running various applications
- **Demo Desktop** (`demo_desktop.py`): Automated demonstration runner showcasing all features
- **Comprehensive Runner** (`run_everything.py`): Orchestrates multiple Python applications and services simultaneously

## Data Processing Architecture

The system implements a robust data processing pipeline:

- **Validation Layer**: Comprehensive data validation with email validation, required field checking, and custom validation rules
- **Processing Engine**: Batch processing with configurable worker threads and timeout handling
- **Model System**: Dataclass-based models with automatic timestamping and update tracking
- **File Service**: Abstracted file operations supporting multiple formats with encoding management

## Configuration System

Uses a hierarchical configuration approach:

- **Base Configuration**: JSON-based configuration files in `resources/config.json`
- **Environment Override**: Environment variables can override file-based settings
- **Runtime Settings**: Dynamic configuration management through the Settings class
- **Logging Configuration**: Structured logging with file rotation and multiple output handlers

## VNC Integration

Includes a complete noVNC HTML5 VNC client implementation:

- **Client Library**: Full-featured VNC client with WebSocket communication
- **UI Components**: Complete user interface with touch and mobile support
- **Multiple Encodings**: Support for Raw, Hextile, Tight, ZRLE, and H.264 encodings
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard, mouse, and gesture input processing

# External Dependencies

## Core Python Libraries

- **Standard Library**: Extensive use of `json`, `csv`, `subprocess`, `threading`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `logging`, `argparse`
- **HTTP Server**: Built-in `http.server` for web interface capabilities
- **Socket Operations**: Network communication for various services

## Frontend Technologies

- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern web standards for user interfaces with RTL language support
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript with module system for VNC client functionality
- **Canvas API**: 2D rendering for VNC display and graphics operations
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication between client and server

## Development Tools

- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite using Mocha and Chai for JavaScript components 
- **Code Quality**: ESLint for JavaScript linting and code quality enforcement
- **Build System**: npm-based build system for frontend components
- **Package Management**: Both npm (frontend) and Python package management

## API Integrations

The system includes examples of external API integration:

- **HTTPBin**: API testing and validation endpoints
- **JSONPlaceholder**: Mock REST API for development and testing
- **GitHub API**: Real-world API integration example

## File Format Support

- **JSON**: Native JSON processing for configuration and data exchange
- **CSV**: Comprehensive CSV reading/writing with encoding support
- **HTML**: Dynamic HTML generation for dashboards and reports
- **Base64**: Encoding/decoding utilities for data transmission
